<h1>CS140 Final Project: Breadth-First Search (Cilk)</hl>
</center>

Breadth-first search is an algorithm for exploring the vertices
and edges of a directed graph, beginning from a particular 
"starting vertex".
It's a simple sequential algorithm, but making it run well in
parallel is challenging.
The "Graph500 Benchmark", which measures what machines are
fastest for graph problems, does a breadth-first search (BFS)
on so-called RMAT graphs.
For this project, you will implement BFS in Cilk and run it
on the RMAT graphs.
There are several directions you can explore:
You can try out exotic data structures to represent the queue 
in the BFS;
you can package your BFS implementation into a full Graph500
code (and then enter the Graph500 competition if you want!);
you can try to tune your code to make efficient use of the
caches on a Triton node.
<p>
<h2> Breadth-First Search </h2>
<p>
BFS explores the vertices and edges of a graph, beginning from
a specified "starting vertex" that we'll call s.
It assigns each vertex a "level" number, which is the smallest
number of hops in the graph it takes to reach that vertex from s.
BFS begins by assigning s itself level 0.
It first visits all the "neighbors" of s, which are the vertices
that can be reached from s by following one edge, and assigns
them level 1.
Then it visits the neighbors of the level-1 vertices: 
some of those neighbors might already be on level 0 or 1, but any
that haven't already been assigned a level get level 2.
And so on -- the so-far-unreached neighbors of level-2 vertices
get level 3, then 4, and so forth until there are no more unreached
neighbors.
<p>
BFS uses FIFO queue to decide what vertices to visit next.
The queue starts out with only s on it, with level[s]=0.
Then the general step is to take the front vertex v from the queue
and visit all its neighbors.  Any neighbor that hasn't yet been
visited is added to the back of the queue and assigned a level
one larger than level[v].
<a href="demo-bfs.pdf">Here is an example of BFS</a>, 
showing the contents of the queue and the level numbers at each step.
There is a nice description of BFS in Cormen et al.'s textbook
"Introduction to Algorithms", and also in 
<a href="http://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.884/spring10/labs/lab4.pdf">this 
handout from MIT</a>.
<p>
There is a sequential C implementation of BFS <a href="code">here</a>.
Say "cat sample.txt | ./bfstest 1" to run the sequential code on the
<a href="demo-bfs.pdf">sample graph</a>.
You should notice several things about this code.
<p>
The FIFO queue data structure is just represented by an array with
"front" and "back" pointers.
This is the data structure you'll have to modify to parallelize the code.
<p>
In addition to the level numbers, the code computes a few other things.
nlevels is one more than the largest level number of any 
vertex reachable from s,
and levelsize[i] is the number of vertices with level i.
Also, for each vertex v, parent[v] is the vertex that caused v to
be assigned a level; that is, parent[v] = w implies that there is 
an edge (w,v) from w to v, and level[v] = level[w]+1.
<p>
The graph data structure uses what's called 
"compressed sparse adjacency lists".
This is a very compact structure that's almost exactly like the
sparse matrix data structure described in class.
There are just two arrays. 
Array nbr[] lists all the neighbors 
of vertex 0, followed by all the neighbors of vertex 1, then
vertex 2, and so on; the number of entries in nbr[] is the
number of edges in the graph.
Array firstnbr[] gives the index in nbr[] of the first neighbor
of each vertex.
Thus, for example, the neighbors of vertex 5 are 
nbr[firstnbr[5]],
nbr[firstnbr[5]+1],
nbr[firstnbr[5]+2],
...,
nbr[firstnbr[6]-1].
If the graph has n vertices, the firstnbr[] array has n+1 elements;
firstnbr[n-1] is the index in nbr[] of the first neighbor of the last
vertex,
and firstnbr[n]-1 is the index in nbr[] of the last neighbor of the
last vertex.
Therefore, firstnbr[n] is equal to the total number of edges in the graph.
This data structure is not very flexible for a dynamic graph -- it's 
hard to add or delete an edge or a vertex -- but it's quite good for a
graph that doesn't change, because it's easy to write a very efficient
loop over the all the neighbors of a given vertex.
<p>
<h2> Parallel Breadth-First Search </h2>
<p>
The idea of doing BFS in parallel is that, in principal, you can
process all the vertices on a single level at the same time.
That is, once you've found all the level-1 vertices, you can
do a parallel loop that explores from each of them to find
level-2 vertices.
Thus, the parallel code will have an important sequential 
loop over levels, starting at 0.
<p>
In the parallel code, it's possible that when you're processing
level i, two vertices v and w will both find the same level-i+1
vertex x as a neighbor.
This will cause a data race when they both try to set level[x]=i+1,
and also when they each try to set parent[x] to themselves.
But if you're careful this is a "benign data race" -- it doesn't
actually cause any problem, because there's no disagreement about
what level[x] should be, and it doesn't matter in the end whether
parent[x] turns out to be v or w.
<p>
A more difficult problem is that all of the threads exploring
level-i vertices will be trying to add new level-i+1 vertices
to the back of the FIFO queue at the same time.
How you resolve this is the main algorithmic question about the
parallel implementation.
There are several possibilities, which we'll leave to your
creative imagination.  
One good solution is described in
<a href="http://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.884/spring10/labs/lab4.pdf">the
MIT handout</a> and also in 
<a href="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1810534">this paper</a>.

<h2> The RMAT Graphs </h2>
<p>
You should debug your code using small example graphs that you
make up by hand.  However, for big runs, you'll use the RMAT
graphs that are defined in the Graph500 specification.
RMAT is a method that generates so-called "power-law" graphs 
of arbitrarily large size.
The <a href="http://graph500.org">Graph500 website</a>
has a sequential Matlab code and a sequential C code to generate
RMAT graphs.
<p>
<h2> The Graph500 Benchmark </h2>
<p>
The Graph500 Benchmark is described 
<a href="http://graph500.org/Specifications.html">here</a>.
The benchmark first generates the list of edges for an RMAT graph,
then converts the edges list into a graph data structure 
like compressed sparse adjancency lists, 
then chooses several vertices at random and does
a BFS from each one, then verifies that the parent[] trees have
been computed correctly.
(The benchmark spec allows you to use a parallel code for each 
individual BFS, but does not allow you to run all the BFS's from 
different starting vertices in parallel.)
Making a full Graph500 code is a bit of work -- in addition to the
BFS kernel (which is the main point), you also have to link in the
graph generator and verifier and so forth.
You can choose where you want to focus your time on this project,
so you don't need to do the full Graph500 implementation unless 
you want to.
But it would be pretty cool to get an implementation that could
get into the ballpark of the top 9 machines/codes listed on the
Graph500 web site.
